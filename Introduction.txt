Introduction

React is a JavaScript Library building fast and interactive user interfaces 
Developed by Facebook in 2011
most popular JavaScript Library for building user interfaces (dominating Angular and View)


All react applications are Components
build bunch of independent isolated and reusable components and compose them together to build a complex user interface
every react application (a tree of components) has atleast one component (root component), this component represent the internal application and contains other child components
ex- Twiter APP has --> NavBar, Profile, Trends, Feed. Feed has --> Tweet,Like 


Implementation --> Component

class Tweet{
	
	state = {};
	
	render(){}

}

//JavaScript Class that has some state and a render method
//state --> data that we want to display when the component is rendered 
//render method --> describe what the UI should look like, output of the render method is a React Element, which is a simple plain JavaScript object that maps to a Dom element (not a real DOM element, virtual DOM)
//when we change the state of a component we get a new react element and react will compare this element and his children with the previous one and figure out what is changed and update the Reat Dom to keep it in sync
//therefore unlike vanilla JavaScript or jQuerry we no need to work with DOM API in browsers (no need to attach event handlers react will automatically update the DOM)


//Angular --> framework/complete solution 
//React   --> library (only takes care of the view and making sure that the view is in sync with the state) [So when building an app with react we need to use other libraries for things like routing or calling HTTP services]


Setup

***install nodeJS (we are using its built-in tools node package manager or NPM to install third-party libraries)
//open command prompt on windows and run this command

npm i -g create-react-app@1.5.2

//i --> short for install 
//-g  -->for global
//create-react-app@1.5.2 --> package and version we are gonna use

//if you are using a mac open terminal and run this command

sudo npm i -g create-react-app@1.5.2

***install a code editor
//visual studio code
//use extension - simple react snippets, prettier (reformat code when saving)


First React App

//create react app package to create a new react application

**//in terminal --> create-react-app my-first-ract-app  //you cannot use capital letters when creating a project  
//this will install react as well as the third-party libraries 
 -lightweight development server
 -web pack for bundeling our files
 -Babel for compiling our JavaScript
//no need to do any configurations(all is done for you but if you want to customize you can use --> npm run eject )

**//in terminal --> cd my-first-ract-app
**//in terminal --> npm start
//this will launch a development server on port 3000 (chrome/default browser - localhost:3000)

//check the created folder(my-first-react-app) by opening it in VSCode
//you can see 3 main folders
 -node_modules --> all the third party libraries as well as react itself
 -public --> public assets - favourite icon, index.html - there is a <div id = "root"></div> this is where our react application is going to appear
 -src --> basic components - app component - responsible for webpage

//app.js --> has a class extends component whic is built in class in react and in it theres a render method which returns a markup

class App extends Component{

	render(){
		
	  return(
		<div className = "App">
		
		</div>
		);

	}

}

//cannot have a in JavaScript
//this is not html this is JSX - javaScript XML -> out put our app
//to work this code we have to pass this code through babel(modern JavaScript compiler) - babel will take this JSX and convert it to plain JavaScript code that browsers can understand
//example - in babeljs.io/repl 
 const element = <h1>Hello World</h1>  -->  var element = React.createElement( "h1", null, "Hello World");

//App.css --> impored by App.js  -> in App.js - import './App.css';


//React code from Scratch - Hello World
delete all the existing files inside src

1. right click and create a file index.js
//check my-first-react-app
